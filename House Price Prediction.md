A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price.

## General Information
#### Problem Statement :
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price.

#### The company wants to know :
Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.

### Business Goal :
To model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

### Steps followed in assignemnt
Step 1: Data understanding

Step 2: Data Cleaning

Step 3: EDA

Step 4: Data preparation

Step 5: Model building and evaluation

Step 6: Observation and inference

## Conclusions
Suggestions for Surprise Housing is to keep a check on these predictors affecting the price of the house.

The higher values of positive coeeficients suggest a high sale value. For the following coeficients
GrLivArea--> Above grade (ground) living area square feet
OverallQual--> Rates the overall material and finish of the house
OverallCond--> Rates the overall condition of the house
TotalBsmtSF--> Total square feet of basement area
GarageArea--> Size of garage in square feet

The higher values of negative coeeficients suggest a decrease in sale value. For the following coeficients
1.PropAge--> Age of the property at the time of seeling
2.MSSubClass--> Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale
